üêü Sharing everything we learn about our aquaponics system.

## Reservoir
We chose a [300 gallon, galvanized oval stock tank](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/countyline-oval-galvanized-stock-tank-3-ft-w-x-8-ft-l-x-2-ft-h-300-gal-capacity) to house our fish. We like the large capacity and the streamline nature of putting it up against a wall or fence (as opposed to a round tank). The [zinc could be a problem though](http://www.zipgrow.com/zinc-in-aquaponics/), so we painted a [clear epoxy](http://a.co/37BybzX) on the inside. We used a power mixer (need link), 3/8" chuck drill (need link), a brush and roller (need link), and some plastic bins (need link).

## Vertical Grow Towers
We're trying two of each type:

1. Split round with media
2. Square with net pods
3. Round with net pods
